### Project Template

### [Tattoo Finder]

### Pitch

This application when create a platform for users to easily find a tattoo artist by their specifications.

### Problem

Although the tattoo industry has grown tremendously within the past decade, there has not been an application for users to easily find artists.  Currently, to locate an artist you must do seperate searches on tattoos and artists to find a style you would like then find their store website and hope to scehdule an appointment online.  This app will create one source when users can search by style, color, price range, etc, and find the perfect artists nearby to scehdule an appointment with.

### Solution

To solve this problem, I will first receive tattoo artists submissions for bio, store details, style preference, etc, and create artists show pages.  Then I will create a home and search page for users to state their preferances and locate the artists that matches their criteria.  Lastly I will have a calander for available dates to select for the users to schedule an appointment.

### Target Audience

The first audience I will be targeting will be new users who have never received a tattoo and don't know where to start.  The second target audience will be users who have received tattoos but are unsatisfied with the work quality and want to seek out better portfolios.  The last target audience will be experienced tattoo users that are simply looking to expand their artwork and want to seek out the best possible artists.

### New Techniques

I am hoping to seperate the front and back end.

### Workflow

I will be using waffle for this project since I am solo and don't need anything too fancy.
